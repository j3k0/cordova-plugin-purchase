(function() {


/// ## <a name="refresh"></a>*store.refresh()*
///
/// After you're done registering your store's product and events handlers,
/// time to call `store.refresh()`.
///
/// This will initiate all the complex behind-the-scene work, to load product
/// data from the servers and restore whatever already have been
/// purchased by the user.
///
/// Note that you can call this method again later during the application
/// execution to re-trigger all that hard-work. It's kind of expensive in term of
/// processing, so you'd better consider it twice.
///
/// One good way of doing it is to add a "Refresh Purchases" button in your
/// applications settings. This way, if delivery of a purchase failed or
/// if a user wants to restore purchases he made from another device, he'll
/// have a way to do just that.
///
/// _NOTE:_ It is a required by the Apple AppStore that a "Refresh Purchases"
///         button be visible in the UI.
///
/// ##### return value
///
/// This method returns a promise-like object with the following functions:
///
/// - `.completed(fn)` - Calls `fn` when the queue of previous purchases have been processed.
///   At this point, all previously owned products should be in the approved state.
/// - `.finished(fn)` - Calls `fn` when all purchased in the approved state have been finished
///   or expired.
///
/// In the case of the restore purchases call, you will want to hide any progress bar when the
/// `finished` callback is called.
///
/// ##### example usage
///
/// ```js
///    // ...
///    // register products and events handlers here
///    // ...
///    //
///    // then and only then, call refresh.
///    store.refresh();
/// ```
///
/// ##### restore purchases example usage
///
/// Add a "Refresh Purchases" button to call the `store.refresh()` method, like:
///
/// ```html
/// <button onclick="restorePurchases()">Restore Purchases</button>
/// ```
///
/// ```js
/// function restorePurchases() {
///    showProgress();
///    store.refresh().finished(hideProgress);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To make the restore purchases work as expected, please make sure that
/// the "approved" event listener had be registered properly
/// and, in the callback, `product.finish()` is called after handling.
///
